# CMPSC200Fall2021FinalProject
Writings

For our Group project Zack and I are going to solve one or more low-end computing problems, programmatically using
either C programming language or MIPS or both. We are going to implement the shift, binary addition, and subtraction operators, converters such as binary to decimal and decimal to binary. We are going to focus on low-end computing tasks to simulate the execution of these tasks through one or more programs implemented in C and/or MIPS.

Project proposal


For our project Peter and I are planning on taking on the Project Track 1 - Low-end Programming Computing Tool. What we plan on doing is creating a calculator tool on the C program in order to accomplish our project. Our calculator will be able to solve addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logarithms, exponents, and so on in C. We are going to create this code from scratch with the help of algorithms from class. We have discussed addition and subtraction during class so it will be easier to implement that. For the exponent operators we will be implementing a multiple multiplication function to achieve what we want. As well we will be doing the same process for logarithms but we will substitute the multiplication for division. we will have an interactive user input line in the command line. we will not be implementing the math.h function in order to ensure all of our calculator functions are built from scratch. We will be able to split the project evenly as this is a two person group and we will meet all deadlines as required. I believe we will not have much problems with the task due to the prior knowledge on it. If we were to encounter problems we would then reach out to either you or the TL's in order to get the project done in enough time.
