For our Group project Zack and I are going to solve one or more low-end computing problems, programmatically using
either C programming language or MIPS or both. We are going to implement the shift, binary addition, and subtraction operators, converters such as binary to decimal and decimal to binary. We are going to focus on low-end computing tasks to simulate the execution of these tasks through one or more programs implemented in C and/or MIPS.
